## Ollie Norman

I am an intelligent, friendly, enthusiastic and fast-learning developer with excellent interpersonal and literacy skills. I truly love to see projects go from nothing to something real and tangible; to start with a problem and finish with a solution. In my past life that might have meant starting with "that looks like a nice beach..." and ending with a fully-fledged international festival that sells out every year; in my current life that means starting with "what do we want this program to do?" and ending with clean, tested and reliable code. The context has changed - the buzz and satisfaction remains the same. I have hands-on experience with Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Rails, React and Agile methodologies.

## Experience

**Various** (2015 to present)  
_Freelance Booker & Events Producer_

- The _other_ kind of programming, working on both one-off contracts and annual repeat clients. 
- With my project management skills, creative planning and curational eye, I have booked and programmed a huge variety of music lineups for events across Europe, including festivals such as Boardmasters, Snowboxx, NASS and Kala, with millions of pounds of talent booked over the years. 
- Extremely high levels of attention to detail and time management were required to successfully manage many projects with many stakeholders simultaneously.
- The many stakeholders, combined with often continually shifting requirements - and the added challenge of artists being part of this mixture - demanded excellent emotional intelligence and communication skills when feeding back and making sure all parties' needs were met.
- Clients have been broad, and I have gained experience in small start-up environments as well as at established multi-national event portfolios. 
- My work ethic, ability to work effectively in a team, organisational skills and desire to see a project through to fruition were particularly brought to the fore when creating Kala Festival in Albania - we had 6 months to create, sell and produce a festival from scratch, in a country that had never hosted an international music festival before. To my great pride, it has now sold out every year since.

**Unicef UK** (2015 to 2015)  
_Public Fundraising Assistant_

- 3 months into my 6-month internship, I was offered a salaried position. 
- I was made responsible for donor communications (across all streams of mass mailouts, individual care and social media campaigns), where I was able to utilise my understanding of a client's or customer's needs and knack for writing engaging copy.
- After spotting major areas for improvement, I pitched my ideas to update the existing system and was subsequently entrusted with improving and streamlining internal team processes - in particular, automating donor pipelines using the very, very old and creaky CRM.

**Unicef UK** (2014 to 2015)  
_Public Fundraising Intern_

- A 6-month internship role making use of, and improving, my skills in customer care, project management and office-based teamwork at one of the worldâ€™s most respected NGOs.

## Skills

#### Project Management

Working as a talent booker and event producer is a continuous cycle of going from concept to delivery - except you have a pile of these cycles all going on at once, each at a different point in the process. This has made me comfortable not only handling multiple projects at once, but also comfortable with the requirements of each stage: creative blue-sky thinking and conceptualisation (for in-house events) or discerning and clarifying the needs of a client (for ongoing contracts); check-ins, updates and implementing feedback from the wider team; and finally delivery, maintenance and learnings.

#### Teamwork

I like people and I like working with people. I'm comfortable listening and supporting, or presenting and leading; I'm genuinely empathetic and great at understanding where other people are coming from on an issue. Spending years being the go-between between financial stakeholders and artist agents makes this an absolute requirement - you are pitcher, negotiator and mediator rolled into one. 

#### Quality Control & Initiative

It nags at me if I feel like there's a smarter, more efficient way of doing something - and I'll want to find out how to do something about it. At Unicef UK I was hired into a salary role halfway through my internship primarily because I spotted inefficiencies in the existing donor pipeline and management system, researched the programs and systems used, and pitched to the department manager to let me work on a new process - which I developed and implemented.

## Education

- Ten years experience as a DJ, with residencies held in multiple cities and many, many hours spent playing in clubs and at festivals. Will talk anyone's hind leg off Francois K's unrivalled use of reverb in his seminal '97 release 'Time & Space', but not too proud to play Mariah Carey.
